# Prompting for Reliable AI Outputs

This repository contains high-level notes and examples on how to communicate effectively with AI systems to improve clarity, alignment, and reliability.

The focus is on writing prompts that reduce ambiguity, surface uncertainty, and encourage safer, more accurate responses — not on bypassing safeguards or forcing outcomes.

## How to read this repository

Examples are intentionally abstracted and simplified.  
They are meant to demonstrate *communication patterns* and *prompt structure*, not reproduce real tasks or system behavior.

The goal is to show how better prompts lead to better alignment — not how to defeat guardrails.
